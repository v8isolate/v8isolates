// Test for collection of abandoned maps

// This test makes a wide, shallow tree of map transitions and maps
// by adding the properties "a" through "j" in a pseudorandom order
// to a new A() object.  This should create map transitions forming
// a partial denary tree.  These objects only stick around for about
// 1000 iterations, with each iteration creating a new object.  Therefore,
// some of the maps going to leaves will become abandoned.
// There are still map transitions going to them though, so
// only the new map-collection code will remove them.

// Every 101 object creations, the object is created again, and tested
// after each property addition to make sure that no map transitions
// are visible as properties.  This is a regression test for a bug.

// Flags: --expose-gc --collect-maps
